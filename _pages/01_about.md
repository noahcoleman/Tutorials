Hi, my name is Noah and I am an educator, maker, tinkerer, and artist.

I created this site as a home for tutorials, how-tos, and to show'n'tell about the stuff I'm into.  At any given moment, that could be CNC milling, electronics, glassblowing, 3D printing, programming, restoring old tools, woodworking, my motorcycle, or education.
