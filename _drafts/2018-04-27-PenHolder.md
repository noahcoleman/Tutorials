I love making drawings with machines.  I used to have access to an old vinyl cutter/plotter that I would make really large drawings with.  Unfortunately, I don't have access to that machine anymore.  What I do have access to, however, is my [Othermill](www.bantamtools.com).  I have seen an example of [drawing with the Bantam Tools mill]() before, but I want to be able to use any pen, not just a cutoff sharpie tip.  So I set out to make a pen mount for my Othermill.

### Design Considerations and Solutions
Bantam Tools provides four M3 tapped holes on the spindle plate for modifications and additions.  I planned to use these holes to mount the pen holder.  I wanted to be able to use a variety of regular pens, so I needed a holder that can adapt somewhat to the size and length of the pen I'm using.  Space is also an issue.  The max x travel is about 5.5" and about 4.5" on the y axis.  That's measured from the point of view of the spindle, so I need to get the tip of my pen as close to the the spindle center as possible to maximize my drawing area.

I sketched out a few ideas on how to get the tip of the pen to line up with the spindle.  In order to draw on as much surface area as possible, I need to hold the pen so it is aligned with the spindle as viewed from the front of the machine.  I eventually settled on a bent sheetmetal plate rather than a part milled from solid stock.  This would require a lot less material, as well as make CAD and CAM easier, but it does mean that I will need a second part to actually hold the pen.

There is not a lot of space under the spindle motor for a pen, so I also designed the pen-holding part to pivot.  That way, I can rotate the pen&mdash;reducing it's overall z height as well as putting the pen tip closer to the spindle center.

I had a pretty good idea of what I needed, so I moved into Fusion 360 to finish the design work.

### Design

#### Sheetmetal
This was my first real experience with Fusion 360's sheetmetal CAD functionality.  Luckily, this was a pretty simple part to model.  I created a sketch based on the hole profile from the Othermill's motor mount and added a flange bent 45&deg; toward the spindle and another one bent 45&deg; the other way to attach the pen-holder to.  I added in the appropriate holes and slots for the pen-holder and rounded the corners.  It was pretty easy to do, and with Fusion 360's parametric environment, it was easy to change the design as I went along.

Using the Flat Pattern generated by Fusion 360, I was able to print a template for the sheetmetal bracket.  I glued this to a piece of chip board, cut out the holes and outlines, and bent it roughly into place.  I used the same screws I was going to use on the final piece to attach this cardboard prototype to the spindle plate to check for fit and function.  I noted what changes I needed to make, adjusted my model in Fusion 360, printed and cut out another flat pattern template from the chipboard, and checked fit again.  This time, it seemed pretty good.  On to the actual holder!

#### Pen Holder
Next up was designing the pen holder&mdash;another simple part.  It's a basic block with a hole going from top to bottom to hold the pen, some holes on the side to attach to the sheetmetal bracket, and a hole in the front for a thumb screw to secure the pen in place.  I milled out a couple of iterations in HDPE and finally got one that was a good balance of size, strength, and function.

Each time I tested the iterations, I made sure to not just test how it fit with the bracket, but also how it fit with a variety of pens that I might use.  I did this to make sure the opening was big enough for the biggest pen I wanted to draw with.

#### Design. Make. Test. Repeat.
One of the things I love the most about digital fabrication in general&mdash;wether it's CNC, laser cutting, 3D printing, or some other process&mdash;is the ability to quickly cycle through design iterations.  Even though it is possible to design something completely in CAD before ever making it a reality, I can think through design problems a lot faster if I have a _thing_ in my hands.  This is especially true when I'm designing something that will interact with another thing in the real world, like, say, the spindle plate of a desktop CNC mill.

Because of this, I try to make that iteration cycle as quick as possible, especially early on.  As YouTube CNC guru John Saunders says, "Fail fast and fail cheap." That's why I tested the sheetmetal design with chipboard and made my pen holders from scraps of HDPE I already had.  These prototypes made it easy to see improvements that could be made without wasting a lot of time or breaking the bank on materials.

### Too Thick, Too Thin, Just Right!
Once I had my design finalized for the bracket and the pen holder, it came time to make them for real.  The pen holder was relatively easy; I just needed to mill the final design out of HDPE like I had been doing for the prototypes.  The sheetmetal, however, was a different story.  The sheetmetal design rules I used in Fusion 360 called for 2mm thick aluminum.  I had a lot of thinner stuff and a lot of 1/8" 6061, but nothing close to 2mm.  I went to my local metal supplier to see if they had any 2mm cutoffs, but none of their cutoffs were marked.  After the trauma of the [offset gauge]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-15-OffsetGauge %}) incident, I was loathe to try milling unknown aluminum alloys, so I decided to work with what I had.  

My first thought was to use my 1/8" stock and just face off what I didn't need.  That way, I could be sure I was milling a good alloy and get the exact thickness I had designed for, with the only drawback being the time milling away all that unneeded material.  I set up my toolpaths in Fusion 360, set up my stock on the Othermill, and pressed "go."  A little less than two hours later I had an absolutely beautiful bracket just waiting to be bent into shape.

I made the first bend with no problems, but partway into the second bend, the material sheared off right where I was bending! After some research, I found that 6061 isn't always the best alloy for bending, especially if it is being bent parallel with the grain of the sheet as it was manufactured.  When I was milling the bracket, I had also had engraved a line into it to mark the bends.  On the first bend, this line was on the inside, so the material on either side of the engraving got mashed together.  On the second bend, the engraved line was on the outside, so the material around it stretched away from the groove, tearing it apart like one of Hulk Hogan's t-shirts.  Not wanting to really go through the whole ordeal of milling the stock down to size again, I went back to my materials bin and pulled out some thinner sheet.

The second bracket I milled out of some used [lithography plate](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhzI0qehiv3/?taken-by=noah.s.coleman).  I'm not sure what the alloy is, but it mills beautifully and it bends well, too.  I omitted the score marks in this version and just marked the spots to bend with a marker.  After it was bent, I mounted it to the Othermill and gave it a test run.  I was able to get a successful drawing, but the thin aluminum sheet was too flimsy to be effective.  Any time the pen met some resistance, the bracket deflected and altered the drawing.  

I finally wound up using some mystery aluminum (I know...I know...) that was closer to the 2mm specified in my sheet metal rules.  Thankfully, it milled just fine and bent just fine, too.  I was able to run a few successful tests with this setup and I was really pleased with the result.  At around 2mm, the bracket is robust enough to withstand some resistance, but doesn't feel overengineered.  

### Draw, partner!

SUCCESSFUL TEST PHOTOS

I was able to make a few drawings with different pens.  One of the weird things about this project is getting the Othermill to know where the tip of the pen is.  The software that controls the mill uses an electrical connection to sense where the tip of the end mill is.  This works by slowly moving the endmill toward the bed.  When the endmill (which is conductive) touches the aluminum bed (also conductive), the circuit is closed and the mill knows where the end of the tool is.  This works great for endmills, which are made of steel or carbide and are conductive.  This does not work great for pens, which may or may not be conductive, and which are also being held in a plastic pen holder (which is definitely _not_ conductive).  To get around this, I had to cheat a little bit by wrapping aluminum foil around the tip of pen and the mounting bracket.  This was pretty cumbersome and I wished the Bantam Tools software had options for manually setting offsets.  

### Things I Learned
I got a number of takeaways from this project
- Getting a prototype in your hands makes iterating and improving the design go much faster.
- It can be really easy to get discouraged when things aren't going as planned or are taking longer than I think they should.  That goes for making blog posts as much as making actual things.
