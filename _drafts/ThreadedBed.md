# Othermill Threaded Bed

Over the holidays, I received my very own Othermill Pro from [Bantam Tools](www.bantamtools.com) and I'm super excited to use it.  Through work, I've used the Othermill Pro, so I already have an idea of what I'm going to use it for.  I know I'll be doing a lot of aluminum machining, so I'd like to get some sturdy, repeatable work holding in place.  Hence, my first project: a threaded bed and some clamps.  Don't get me wrong, Bantam's [advanced fixturing bracket and toe clamps](https://www.bantamtools.com/collections/fixturing/products/precision-fixturing-and-toe-clamp-set?_ga=2.195112044.1147645160.1514592829-1543244777.1514592829) are pretty awesome, and I'd love to get one, but I don't have the green to spend on that right now.  So, for about $30 in materials, I think I can make a pretty good alternative.  Plus, this threaded table will be able to hold thinner material that wouldn't be as ideal with Bantam's fixturing bracket.

### Design
I drew this up in [Fusion 360](www.autodesk.com/fusion360) and it's a pretty simple design: a 1/2" thick piece of aluminum with eighty M4 tapped holes (I know, I mixed my US & metric--heresy!).  There's four counterbored holes for attaching to the Othermill's Y-bed and that's about it.  For the clamps, I modeled up a very basic clamp with a threaded hole and a slot.  I figure two or three of these should hold most stuff down pretty well.
I am a little worried I'm going to run into Z axis clearance problems, so I'm going to mill this all out of some cheaper/softer material first so I can get a good idea of how this is all going to fit in the mill.
