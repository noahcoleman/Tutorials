I manage the glassblowing shop at [Ringling College of Art & Design](www.ringling.edu) and I have been wanting to make some stamps for the hot glass.  Technically, they're called [prunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunt) and they're used to stamp designs into blobs of hot glass that have been applied to a vessel or other object.  I wanted to see if I could both recreate a traditional prunt design, as well as make a unique design of my own.

#### Design
I started out with a raspberry prunt which, besides sounding like a rude thing to call someone, is also pretty simple to make from a modeling standpoint.  I modeled up the design in [Fusion 360](FUSIONLINK) and set up the file for milling.  

#### Workholding
Since I plan on mounting the stamp to a handle with a bit of threaded rod, I decided that using the threaded hole on the back for workholding as well.  I made a little aluminum jig with a shallow pocket to help align my stock.  I mounted the blank to the jig with a flathead screw and then mounted the jig to the bed of my [Bantam Tools](www.bantamtools.com) mill using the t-slots and some M5 screws.
