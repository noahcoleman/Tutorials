Over the last couple weeks, I've seen a few videos around YouTube talking about using masking tape and cyanoacrylate glue for CNC fixturing.  The first was from [Winston Moy](https://www.winstonmoy.com) at the end of January where he demonstrated the relative strength of masking tape/CA vs. Nitto P-02 and gave his thoughts on it's workholding ability.

Then this week, John Saunders of [NYC CNC](https://www.nyccnc.com/) put out a video demonstrating a similar process and doing some pretty impressive machining with it.

I have a lot of experience using Nitto P-02 tape for milling all kinds of things on my CNC mill, but I hadn't heard of the masking tape/CA combo before Winston's video.  I'm already intrigued enough to try it out, but just out of curiosity I did some back-of-the envelope calculations on the cost-effectiveness of P-02 vs MT/CA.  All of these prices came from Amazon, so they may change if you go to your local hardware or craft store for the tape and glue.

|Item                        ||Price |Area              |Price/in<sup>2</sup>      |
| :------------------------- || ---: | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
|Nitto P-02 (.75in. x 36yd.) ||$20.99|972in<sup>2</sup> |**0.022 $/in<sup>2</sup>**|
|Loctite 4851 (20g bottle)   ||$24.63|                  |                          |
|Blue Tape (1.88 in x 60 yd.)||$6.58 |4061in<sup>2</sup>|                          |
|Blue Tape/CA Glue Combo     ||$31.21|                  |**0.007 $/in<sup>2</sup>**|

I was totally blown away by how much cheaper the MT/CA is compared to the P-02.  Even if the bottle of CA glue doesn't last the whole roll, you could replace it *twice* and still come up cheaper per square inch than the P-02.  Now, you still have to deal with the inconvenience of making your own double-sided tape. But that is offset, in part, by the fact that you can burnish the tape onto both the mill bed and the stock, thus increasing the holding power of the tape. I have had stock lift with P-02 because the tape was not sufficiently adhered to the bed (partly because burnishing the tape onto the bed is nearly impossible with all but the thinnest materials).  I can't say if the same will happen with the masking tape, but the ability to burnish the tape onto the bed makes me think this won't be an issue.

As always, I'd love to hear your feedback.  Contact me below!
